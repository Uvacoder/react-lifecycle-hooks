# @erkobridee/react-lifecycle-hooks

According to [A Complete Guide to useEffect | Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/)

> Keep in mind that the mental model for effects is different from componentDidMount and other lifecycles, and trying to find their exact equivalents may confuse you more than help

So, to keep peace of mind and manage any function component lifecycle, follow the equivalents hooks to the cases: `useConstructor`, `useDidMount`, `useDidUpdate` and `useWillUnmount`, plus `useForceRender`
